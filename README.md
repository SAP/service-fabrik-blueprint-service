Blueprint-Service
=======================

Background
----------

### What is the Blueprint-Service?

This service is a sample to demonstrate how services are integrated into the [Service-Fabrik-Broker](https://github.com/SAP/service-fabrik-broker).
As part of the decoupling process in which the services get more and more separated from the broker itself, the Blueprint-Service serves as sample for the service teams to answer questions how to integrate a service into the broker.
